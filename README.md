# Differentiable search of meta-parameters in neural networks
The experiments in both the cases below are run using the **CIFAR-10** dataset (the 50,000 training examples split differently according to the experiments).
1. To run the code to find the weights for each example: `python main_hp.py`
2. To run the search using the tri-level optimization: `python main_hp_two_stage.py`
